During my time there we did various small hardware installs but our main project was upgrading the school support website from Drupal 7 to 9 so the majority of the skills I learned were php web development, Symfony, and MySQL queries.

						<p>I think one of the most important skills someone can have is problem solving. All it takes is a little persistance and curiosity but it can be suprisingly dificult to stay with a problem long enough to solve it. Over the last few years I have encountered a lot of obstacles that I have had to overcome which have greatly increased my ability to problem solve.

During my freshman year I volunteered and ran one of their after school branches. At the end of my freshman year I joined the executive team and started to manage their funding and grant proposals and did that for about a year and a half raising over $10,000 for the organization. We also helped to distribute meals to families in need at the begining of COVID during the gap before the city started distributing food. Unfortunatly we had to stop doing in person activities and did not require funding and by the time they started up again I had too many other commitments so I have not been able to do anything with the organization since August of 2020.  </p>

                    <p>I have attended Sanborn Western Camps every summer for the last seven years (except for 2020). This summer camp has honestly changed my life between the friends I met there, the appreciation for our beautiful planet I have gotten from living in the Colorado wilderness for a month every year, and the service I have done which has included a week long trip every year for the last three years entirely dedicated to service. My time at Sanborn has taught me that I need to use my time here to help improve our world and to think of things bigger than my little bubble I tend to get stuck in going to a private school in St. Louis. Also it has greatly decreased my reliance on technology as we are disconnected from all technology while we are there. My final year was in the summer of 2021 where I was an &quot;Outbacker&quot; which is sort of a half camper half councilor. </p>

I have since found that the credits it gave me when I got it were falsified and there is not a record of who the origainal creator was. The HTML and CSS have been modified greatly by me so I still feel it is acceptable to use for this purpose. I would include a link to the origainal template but it has since been removed from the website I got it from. If for some reason you want to go through the code and formatting the Github account I used is @hledbetter124.</span></li>
